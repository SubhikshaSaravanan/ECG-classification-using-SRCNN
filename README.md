This project concentrates on classifying the heartbeats into 5 different categories namely:
1.Normal beats
2.Unknown beats
3.Ventricular ectopic beats
4.Supraventricular ectopic beats
5.Fusion beats
using Super Resolution Convolutuional Neural Network, which can be ultimately used to distinguish and diagnose specific type of arrhythmia in the patient. The SRCNN algorithm is employed on the MIT-BIH dataset. By adopting the appropriate construction of the convolutinal layers using various paramters, The final model tested for an accuracy of 97.13%. The confusion matrix for the derived result is also drafted.
